## Step Evidence

### Task 1 Step 1
#### Attempt 1
**Status:** Completed
**Recorded At:** 2026-03-18T12:34:17Z
**Execution Source:** superpowers:executing-plans
**Claim:** Added the initial failing public CLI regression scaffold.
**Files:**
- tests/codex-runtime/test-superpowers-workflow.sh
**Verification:**
- Manual inspection only: Created the scaffolded shell test and confirmed it targets the missing public CLI binary.
**Invalidation Reason:** N/A

### Task 1 Step 2
#### Attempt 1
**Status:** Invalidated
**Recorded At:** 2026-03-18T12:42:46Z
**Execution Source:** superpowers:executing-plans
**Claim:** Ran the new public CLI scaffold test and observed the expected missing-binary failure.
**Files:**
- None (no repo file changed)
**Verification:**
- Manual inspection only: bash tests/codex-runtime/test-superpowers-workflow.sh failed because bin/superpowers-workflow does not exist yet.
**Invalidation Reason:** Step 2 was checked before the non-mutation scaffolding was actually added.

#### Attempt 2
**Status:** Completed
**Recorded At:** 2026-03-18T12:43:32Z
**Execution Source:** superpowers:executing-plans
**Claim:** Added red non-mutation coverage scaffolding for manifest and repo-doc stability.
**Files:**
- tests/codex-runtime/test-superpowers-workflow.sh
**Verification:**
- Manual inspection only: Extended the public CLI regression scaffold with explicit no-create, no-backup, no-rewrite, and repo-doc byte-stability cases.

### Task 1 Step 5
#### Attempt 1
**Status:** Completed
**Recorded At:** 2026-03-18T12:44:57Z

**Files:**
- None (no repo file changed)
**Verification:**
